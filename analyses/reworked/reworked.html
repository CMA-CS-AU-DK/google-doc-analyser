</p><p>Over the past two decades, the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) has drastically expanded its scope of concern beyond the workplace and forayed into various aspects of personal and social life with respect to the design and use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Recent research trends in HCI about Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), and robotics reveal complex socio-technical issues concerning human agency, civic responsibility, and technological automation at an unprecedented scale. Such issues are recognized and voiced increasingly by scholars in the field at a meta-discursive level, often as ‘Grand challenges for HCI’. For instance, Shneiderman et al. advocate for a “shift from user experience to community experience” and “to ensure human control while increasing the level of automation” (Shneiderman et al 2016). Similarly, Engeström et al. highlight moving from ‘consumer cultures’ towards ‘cultures of participation’ and propose “a focus on increased openness, participation, and inclusion of diverse communities, disciplines, and people” (Engeström et al 2010).
</p><p>
</p><p>Meaningful engagement with complex socio-technical issues require robust theories and methodological tools to design effective interventions and measure impacts over time. Reflecting on epistemological trajectories and current challenges in HCI, Bødker foregrounds the need for “understanding and conceptualizing multitudes of artifacts and the ways in which they mix in activities that people do together” (Bødker 2015) moving forward. Surveying existing conceptualizations of the term ‘interaction’ in HCI, Hornbæk and Oulasvirta argue that “these concepts are associated with different scopes and ways of construing the causal relationships between the human and the computer” and postulate the necessity for “theoretic statements that link the determination between humans and computers, given certain starting conditions and boundary conditions” (Hornbæk and Oulasvirta 2017). In short, there is a need for conceptualizing how interactive objects (i) shape human agency and (ii) structure social relationships, (iii) both in individual and group settings.
</p><p>This current proposal offers a way of thinking where interactive objects are explored in order to maintain and extend human control over the technological environment, by human beings, both individually and together. Common interactive objects are seen as a way of addressing such human control over technology.  They tie together an understanding of use and of building user interfaces in a coherent framework, to be applied in interaction design. This proposal, hence, offers a new focus on the relationship between technology and its use, as interactive, common objects that are mediators of collaborative human activity.

</p><p>Different prototypical ex­amples of common and boundary objects are, e.g. family calen­dars (Bødker &amp; Grönvall, 2013), pa­rental leave plan­ning (Borchorst et al., 2009; Borchorst &amp; Bødker, 2011), shared art cu­ration (Bødker &amp; Polli 2014) and community artifact ecologies for food sharing (Bødker et al 2016a and b). Mediating qualities of such com­mon interactive ob­jects, their po­tentials for sharing and boundary drawing, need better conceptual foundation and CIO set out to provide that. We propose that we may address elements of Common Interactive Objects as as interim-level or strong concepts (Höök &amp; Löwgren 2012). They list five characteristics:

Rethinking the presenta­tion as a common interactive object means that the presentation could be shared between lecturer and stu­dents, both during and after a lecture, in different and controlled ways. Breaking Breaking away from the idea that the presentation be­longs solely to the presenter, and offering controlled sharing as common interactive objects, poses techno­logical and conceptual challenges will work with, based on examples like common interactive objects in local communities, university lectures, etc.

Such mediMqualities of com­mon isuch nteractive ob­jects, and theirtentials and boundng and boundary drawing need bet,ter conceptual foundation and CIO set out to provide that.
</p><p>
</p><p>These examples show the challenges of addressing interaction as it unfolds over time and in collaboration between people, and it is the somputing technology as such. Thus, they will support multiplicity and diversity, both regarding what technical solutions may work across which technical platforms, in terms of human control over interaction with the technology as such, and in terms of providing the means, and a language for more diverse communities of users to apprehend and develop their own technologies.
</p><p>
</p><p>When carried through, the project offers new ways for people to construct and configure their physical and virtual environment, together, over time and within communities. It offers to support their shared needsve ways for people to have shared control over data, artifacts and technological environments as alternative to the current trends where Internet of Things, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence threaten to take control away from people. CIO has roots in the discussions of Palpable Computing developed in the PALCOM project, and also e.g. pliant computing (Henderson &amp; Harris). Palcom in particular questioned technology as 'invisibility', 'ulti-layered understanding of objects to support analysis and design of hu­man-computer interaction.  While these ap­proaches have been criticized for oversimplifying the relationships between objects in the world (and actions on them) and ob­jects and actions in the interface (see e.g. Lafon 2000, Kaptelinin &amp; Nardi 2006), they are nonetheless among the models that give hope for understanding use, and the mediating role of the interface (see Bødker 1991). In Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), boundary objects are used to address and under­stand sharing and cooper­ation within Beaudouin-Lafonnities and across time and place (Star, 1989). Boundary objects are of various types such as repositories and forms, and are often understood in networks, ecologies and in­frastructuring processes where objects are broughthe context of t together, configured and replaced over time (Karesti et al 2010, Pipek &amp; Wulf 2009). In Participatory Design, objects of participation and engage­ment aBeaudouin-Lafonudied (Kautz, 2009; Bødker, 1studies revealed o98, Bø inr et al. 2016c) and run-away obtröm, 2007), software that has been modi­fied by be these based in mock-ups, prototypes or more classical design representations.

</p><p>Norman (1999) is famous, but also disputed for his use of Gibson’s affor as run-away objectsdances in understanding use (and design) of human-computer interaction. Gibson, in contrast to Norman, strongly emphasized that affordances are action possibility, not properties that dictate correct use.

</p><p>Objects in general are in focus, and critically examined e.g. in Heath &amp; Luff (1996): “In CSCW particular attention has focused on the development of flexible computer architectures and infrastructures to support different ways of collaboratively accessing (information, or computer) objects. These aim to support a range of capabilities from the simple exchange of objects, through the sharing of objects and to common views of the same object. However, when considering even the case of the simple record card, this range appears to be unduly limited. This may be due to the rather static conception of the object that pervades most current CSCW platforms. The practices which support the writing and reading of the paper record cards relies on a complex interrelationship between the items in an entry, the entries and the collection as a whole. This relationship is more than a simple hierarchy leading from the single component through to the record as a whole. It also relies on more than just providing more ‘links’ between items and entries, as in some complex hypertext system.” e and ex­tend the use of Gibson’s (1979) affordances with activity theory (see also Bødker &amp; Klokmose 2011, Kaptelinin &amp; Nardi, 2006). Bærentsen &amp; Trettvik (2002) point out that activ­ity theoreti­cal HCI, rather than affordances, better bridge conceptually between understanding and doing, be­tween individual and shared practices and between history and change. This motivates also the choice to work with activity-theoretical HCI where objects in general and interactive objects in particular are the central foci of analysis and understanding (Bødker 1991). Bærentsen &amp; Trettvik (2002) are critical to Norman’s (1999) attempt to solve the confusion of how af­fordances are used in HCI. Hartson (2003) develops a leveled anal­ysis of artifacts based on affordances and Bødker &amp; Klokmose (2011) criticize his as­sumption that anyone immediately and directly perceives the signification and function of an object. With CIO the idea is to bridge immediate actions (as the affordance notion points to) with more complex forms of conception and devel­opment as offered by activity theoretical HCI. 
</p><p>
</p><p>Distributed cognition, from e.g. Hutchins &amp; Klausen (1996) to Hollan et al. (2000) shares many ideas with activity theoretical HCI. We need to address the multiplicity of objects across time (history), collaborators (shar­ing), use activities (seamlessness), where activity theory and distributed cognitiand ffer a promising founda­tion.
</p><p>Fand in this regards
</p><p>Past research includes interaction around common or shared objects, within and across groups of us­ers where boundary objects are useful concepts for under­standing and designing (Borchorst et al., 2009; Borchorst &amp; Bødker, 2011; Bohøj et al., 2010, 2011). Boundary objects are, in Star and Grisemer’s (1989) classic definition, ob­jects that “are both plastic enough to adapt to local needs and constraints of the several parties employing them, yet robust enough to mai. ain a common identity across sites. They are weakly structured in common use, and become strongly structured in individual-site use.” Boundary objects in the setting of CIO are e.g. the presentation of the lecturer in the  Similarly, postphenomenology (Hasse 2013, Rosenberger 2017) points to directions of common concern when talking about mediation, multistability, interviewing objects, etc. auditorium, or curatorial art pieces in an art gal­lery. Sharing and collaboration around objects and artifacts were discussed extensively in CSCW in the 1980s and 1990s. Robinson (1992) pointed out that having and holding in common means to have access to and use, without using specifically together all the time and for the same purpose. He introduced the idea of the common artifact to help understand what it means to share artifacts or objects. 
</p><p>
</p><p>Throughout we are moving in a space where technology is used on the one hand, by users, in a mediated relationship with other objects, as what Bødker (1991, 1999) calls artifacts. At the same time these technological objects have our focus and attention as object of our activity, be these in breakdown situations (Bødker 1991) or more deliberate design and building situations (Bødker 1999). Objects are outcomes of building processes in general and when it comes to interactive objects, they are outcomes of design and programming processes. However in­teractive objects are also mediators that stand between users and other object,  the common artifact to help understand what it means to share artifacts or objectsr (Bødker 199s1, Lafon 2000). It is the quality of this standing in between that has been dis­cussed in HCI, often dressed up as transpar­ency or in the Ubicomp setting as seamlessness (Dourish, 2001). Seamfulness, where human beings meet object boundaries, (Chalmers &amp; Galani, 2004) is often present in the physical world, but seems to be lacking when it comes to interactive objects.  Bødker &amp; Klokmose (2011) emphasize further the need to focus on objects and artifacts in plural and talk about artifact ecologies. Bertelsen &amp; Bødker (2002), Bødker &amp; Bøgh Andersen (2005) ex­emplify how multi­ple mediators for specific activities may be connected.
</p><p>
</p><p>Objects have many roles in interaction design at large: The idea of the future projectBeaudouin- is an ideal object at the same time as the future project has many manifest forms in the design process, in various representations and pro­totypes, in­dependent of the future outcome of design. Objects furthermore offer specific hands-on possibili­ties for users (Bødker, 1991; Halskov &amp; Dalsgaard, 2006) hence empowering users by connecting to their past prac­tices while helping them get hands on the new possibilities. Fundamentally this is why common interac­tive objects may provide better ways of empowering users to understand, apprehend and develop technolo­gies.
</p><p>
</p><p>Bødker &amp; Christiansen (2012), borrowing from Carroll et al  Mediation is not a concept unique to activity theoretical HCI. Postphenomenology has in parallel developed developed its understanding, and has impacted HCI, and several papers discuss both, e.g. Hasse (2013). (1996)  define appropriation as “the way that users evaluate and adopt, adapt and integrate a technology into their everyday practices”. They described how, through use, idiosyncratically and in collaboration with others, people make the iPhone and its app-world their own. In doing so, ‘the interviewees have expanded their scope of what activity is enabled by their iPhone’. According to Bødker &amp; Christiansen (2008) appropriation happens in the social context first, and only later at an individual level, and that once appropriation has happened on the individual level, not only specific apps, but the whole idea of using a mobile device to accessing the world of apps becomes ‘second nature’ to the user. All of the.se analyses further illustrate a fundamental tension between the change/ appropriation process on the one hand and the artefacts on the other. This change process is both technical and social. They emphasize what Roth &amp; Jornet (2018) called a fluent ontology, where the focus is on the change, the process, over the objects of artefacts, while the analysis pay attention to how the objects also, at the same time, bo12 supports and hinders such change.
</p><p>
</p><p>Several recent papers have been addressing the innovative power of e.g. non-government organizations through Participatory Design and social technologies (see e.g. Björ­gvinsson et al., 2010; Bratteteig &amp; Wagner, 2012).  Bottom-up design is discussed as democratic or “in the wild” innova­tions (Hagen &amp; Robertson, 2010). For CIO the cooperation and bottom-up design raise concerns for understandability of objects, transparency of decisions behind the development of objects etc., giving additional meaning to Hollan et al.’s (2000) notion of history enriched objects. These aspects are, however, not well developed, and the assump­tions that objects provide understandability and empower users (from the bottom up) need further re­search in CIO. 
</p><p>Activity is the starting point for artefacts and, historically, operations from earlier generations are crystallised into next generation artefacts and/or artefacts are representations of certain modes of acting in the activity. Bærentsen(REF) made an analysis of the historical development of the hand gun, from the perspective of how n1989organizing principles (war formations), new technologies (e.g. gun-powder and cartridges), training of soldiers, new affordances, etc. all have developed in a dialectical relationship and left traces in hand guns as they have developed historically. As practice develops over time, concern for the historical context of such interactive objects is essential to ac­tivity theoretical HCI.  Activity theory was originally intro­duced in HCI to point out that the relationship between the human being and the computer is not a simple subject-object or subject-subject relationship: Instead of studying the rela­tionship between the user and the computer as something that the user works on, or communicates with. With the current array of technologies, this mediation is of­ten on common software objects on individual physical devices, but Bødker (2015) also discusses common interaction through large physical forms of interaction. 
</p><p>
</p><p>Recent work (Bødker &amp; Klokmose, 2011, 2012, 2016) has provided a detailed understanding of IT-based medi­ation through the Human-Artifact Model. Artefact ecologies have previously been used to analytically embrace the use and development of particular artefacts, such as the iPhone, in multiple activities and situations with multiple users, who appropriate the artefacts for their individual and shared uses. (Bødker &amp; Klokmose 2012)  in particular presented an analytic model to address the dynamics of artefact ecologies. They focus on one artefact at a time, while addressing how configurations that this artefact is part of, change over time and use, within and across communities, a perspective that was extended by (Bødker et al. 2016a, 2016b). Artefact ecologies also point to context in terms of community, other technologies, history as well as place or location (see also e.g. Korsgaard 2016). Despite this, and as proposed by Bødker (2015), the concept of context remains elusive and still poorly understood. We need an expanded view of context beyond what is commonly considered in areas such as pervasive computing: physical place, time, action state and user profiling. With the activity theoretical perspective of the activity as the unit of analysis, context frames what lies behind that, historically or in other ways outside the activity, such as other activities, communities and places. 
</p><p>
</p><p>To comprehend the development or artifact ecologies including multiple ones (Bødker 2018) proposes that it is necessary to move the analyses beyond the development of the singular artifact in use. Stability as well as unrest is caused, not only by the single artefact as it is used and causing tensions and breakdowns, but also by trajectories of change of other artefacts being used, and appropriated in certain ways, simultaneously or not. 
</p><p>
</p><p>Nicoloni el al. (2018) present different theoretical approaches to objects and state that: “Objects alli us both to act at a distance and to make our. They understand objects as performing at least three types of work: motivate and allow collaboration; allow participants to work across different types of boundaries; constitute the fundamental infrastructure o et al.f the activity. They are also multiple,  heterogeneous and potentially  conflictual Theyeraction endure beyond the present. What makes human sociality distinctive, then, is that practices are not merely constellations of intersubjectivity, they are also constellations of “interobjectivity” (Latour 1996, p. 234).” They talk about objects pointing towards the future as epistemic objects to explain the ‘structure of wanting’ and incompleteness of the object as something that we works towards, together. 
</p><p>
</p><p>In some ways, Bødker &amp; Klokmose’s (2016) work on concptual blends (Fauconnier and Turner, 2008) also point towards the ways in which the conceptual background of objects also through blends, point ahead, as well as to Enges.tröm (1986) and Bertelsen (1996) who discuss the ways secondary and tertiary artefactness overlayers the primary artefact, or object.
</p><p>The project draws its inspiration from many theoretical fields in and around HCI that have so far helped shape the thinking of computer-mediated act, distributed cognition, and situated inter­action. It addresses understandings of cooperation and sharing, e.g. boundary objects and infrastructuring; and alternative ways of building interfaces, across hard­ware platforms from ubiquitous computing, small and large displays, and web technology. It reaches out to object thinking in programming, to innovation research studies of materiality, Computer Supported Cooper­ative W7rk, as well as to in8eraction design. 
</p><p>
</p><p>The analytic shift of focus from the artefacts to the process of change and appropriation allows for understanding how specific choices made in the design of each artefact, be it hardware device or software app, or infrastructural components from cloud services, to mobile internet plans and app stores mutually support and hinder change towards what users want, in many ways. What users want can be understood only in a dialectical tension with what they can get, which is then in turn undergoing change, though not always the changes that the users prefer. 
</p><p>Defining Common Interactive Object 
</p><p>CIO proposes that the analytical and conceptual richness of objects need to be brought into play in build­ing and sharing objects. CIO stands on a foundation of related work in activity theory, dis­tributed cognition, and situated interaction (Bødker, 1991; Hollan et al., 2000; Suchman, 1987) which all, with some differences, have been used in HCI to point to the situated and mediated nature of human-com­puter interaction. Fundamentally, activity theoretical HCI (Bødker, 1991; Bertelsen &amp; Bødker, 2003) led to extending HCI to focus on analysis and design for a particular work practice with concern for qualifications, work environment, division of work, etc. Activity theoretical
</p><p>From analysis to generative theory
</p><p>We want to not only understand technology in use differently, but also to reshape it with a scientific basis, we are hence aiming to make the theory generative (see Bødker et al in prep.). 
</p><p>
</p><p>The analyses of (Bødker et al in prep.) speak to the need for theory to help innovate interaction. Currently, CIO is mainly analyzing the problems but the point is to move beyond that in the years to come.
</p><p>
</p><p>Innovating interaction comes at three levels of processes: (Research-based) new interaction concepts, (extrinsic) design projects that target particular use situations and organizations/user communities, and the ongoing (intrinsic) development in use. CIO is concerned with engaging these levels with one another.
</p><p>
</p><p>We are explicitly interested in designing for change: The user experience is not static, but rather dynamic, changing as the user and the user's context changes over time.  We need generative theory that is both a generative process for sparking / inspiring new design ideas and in the sense that the interaction needs to be changeable over time. 
</p><p>HCI focuses on the appropriate­ness Users and context
</p><p>of certain tools for certain practices and on the inter­active objects that human beings shape a, generatively,nd appro­priate as tools. 
</p><p>
</p><p>In this perspective, common interactive objects are developed in collaborative human activity and they are used in (other) collaborative human activity, in both sort of cases with a purpose, by people, as designers or users (who are working with them as artifacts on other objects of activity). Common interactive objects, like other objects of activity exist both as material and as outcome, in the process in an interim or ideal form addressing the future object as it will eventually become.
</p><p>
</p><p>In both design and use, the common interactive object of interest is surrounded by multitudes of other objects (materials and ideal objects), artifacts, and people, in overlapping purposeful activities and communities of prac
</p><p>In order to situate the potential common interactive object in context of communities of practice, other artifacts and objects and places of use it is important to address:Users/participants•	Who are the users/participants? Are they identified, identifiable, anonymous, or a mix?•	What are their goals? •	What skills do they have regarding the common interactive object?Designers•	Who are the designers? •	What are/were their goals?Context•	What other objects, materials and artifact are in the ecology?•	What communities of practice? Cross-disciplinary - mono-disciplinary (across – within	communities of practice)•	What division of work is in place?•	What (other) means of cooperation, e.g. language, rules?•	What places do use happen? Is use collocated or remote?•	What are the historical trajectories behind the current common interactive object?•	What future visions/epistemic objects can be identified in the community?tObjectsice (wha currentt we talk about as (community) artifact ecologies). All of this happens in ever-ongoing dialectical relationships with transformation processes of many kinds (Roth &amp; Jornet 2018), happening intrinsic to the use activity as well as outside of it (Kaptelinin &amp; Bannon, 2014). However, Roth &amp; Jornet (2017, 2018) cautions against mediation being everything and propose to focus instead on the flow of interactions as it continuously constitutes the context, and interpretive frame for future interactions.

</p><p>
</p><p>Interactive in the context of CIO is to embrace both physical and virtual, as well as human action Interactive in the context of CIO is to embrace both physical and virtual, as well as human action and control, i.e. the ways in which our objects are designed to, or actually ‘talk back’ when they are used. Interactive is also because the project addresses interactive technology, interactions design, etc. and not materials, products and objects of all sorts.Wiberg et al. (2013) see this as a radical shift of perspectivm how c &amp; Oulasvirtaomput­ers can be applied as tools in the hands of users to the compu­tational as material. Gross et al. (2013) how­ever, see it as a continuation of older concerns in HCI. Digital materials may be without (physical) properties (Lövgren &amp; Stolterman, 2004), they may lack properties, or be entangled with physical properties (Pierce &amp; Paulos 2013). In particular, the focus on physical materials and embedding computation into ma­teriality is important for CIO so as to address interactive ob­jects as providing materiality to design, pro­gramming and use.

</p><p>Current re­search on tangible and embedded interaction and tangible user interfaces (Ullmer &amp; Ishii, 2000; Shaer &amp; Hornecker, 2010), is of inter­est because these ways of designing adds physical properties to the virtual. Studies of user interface aesthetics and artistic practices have led to a general focus on programs as materials (see also Bertelsen et al., 2007; Hansen et al., 2014) and awe equally relevant to CIO. In our conceptual understanding, acting and thinking with objects go hand in hand, and certainly the framework to address common, interactive objects needs to be developed when it comes to these aspects. In particular the resistance provided, and by the interactive objects and the effort needed (Bertelsen et al 2007), the possibilities of shaping and reshaping them (their malleability) is a key concern in CIO. 
</p><p>
</p><p>Getting back to Kay’s clay of computing, his focus was originally on building, on programming, whereas that of CIO is equally on use and appropriation. A possible take on the issues of control would be empower people to be able to use/express themselves with computational materials in a way that goes beyond being only recipients/consumers of other people’s product, hence to help people to be able to create/participate in creating their own computational objects. How this is done may be even more challenging exactly when the computational objects are also physical and tangible.
</p><p>
</p><p>Interactivity has connections to aesthetics of interaction due to the focus on sensory and perceptual experience (see earlier PIT work). As illustrated in the work of McCarthy &amp; Wright (2004) experience is addressed in human activity by looking back and looking ahead, and sharing happens (as it is not very developed in (McCarthy &amp; Wright 2004)) in recounting, retelling and reflection.
</p><p>
</p><p>Research on blended interaction (O’Hara et al., 2011; Jetter et al., 2014, Bødker &amp; Klokmose 2016) point in a useful di­rection: It seems that blended interaction can be under­stood and provided with a better conceptual and tech­nological basis through object-thinking as outlined in CIO. Looking back on past experiences and mak­ing active use of these in building new objects, has a large, underdeveloped potential for empowering users.

They investigate constructs of interaction in HCI, their meaning and impact for design and evaluation. While addressing the determination adopted or inscribed in the interaction cThey addressall assume teleological determination (human intentions postulate a morwhich are goal of interaction), while some theories veer towards mechanical determinism under limitednormachieving limited predictive power, other veering towards structural determination (or none a all) with broad scope, and somepower.  &amp; Oulasvirta  
</p><p>
</p><p>With this effort they identify theoretical holes and a general disconnection between theoretical constructs that run largely side-by-side without much dialog. Of the interactivity perspectithey st runudy, there is a notable focus on single-human-computer interaction, and an absence of constructs that address interactivity in common, the computational agent/material as part of larger conversation between humans. For designers, this hinders their ability to conceive of and anticipate how  foOulasvirta &amp; Hornbækthe different role of computational agency (or material) in interactivity (either from an explanatory or predictive perspective) when compared to other human made or natural objects. 
</p><p>
</p><p>From this work it appears that working out a pla-sible, falsifiable extension of an existing theory or combination of perspectives with complementary strengths (e.g., tools use &amp; embodiment, experience &amp; control, etc.) together with a design operationalization that could enable empirical testing, would be needed to overcome some of the current limitations of theoretical constructs, regarding scope and determinacy. Certainly, in addressing theHornbæk &amp; Oulasvirta the study and operationalization of Common Interactive Objects as a perspective or overarching theory of interaction, this theoretical construction poses both a useful challenge and opportunity. 
</p><p>
</p><p>Baecker et al (1993) as an example of shared interactivity discussed various (collaborative) text editors and the extent to and granularity with which they support collaborative writing activities of different nature. While the technologies are long outdated, the taxonomical requirements may still stand:

</p><p>Automatic &amp; Human control ? maybe we should drag something here from the worIn Bødker et al. (2018) we discuss the roles of automation and control in human partnerships mediated by interactive objects. Karpatchof (1984) talks about artifacts or tools as either actively or passively externalized, and use this to discuss the role of classical AI when it comes to mediation of human activity, following Leontjev's idea that only that which is routinized can be automated. What would this idea mean for the computer-mediated, human partnerships, mediated by interactive objects? We point out how automation without previous routinization

Still, automated behavior does not need to constrain; on the contrary, it can function as an aspect of interactive objects. Equally, the interactive object may transparently enable further appropriation (e.g. automatic background recalculation in a spreadsheet). As such, dealinwhen it comes tomation can lead to an emergence of diverse love-hate socio-technical relationships, with varying degrees of stability and interpretive flexibility.

</p><p>Substantial CSCW research has been done on the subject of technology mediated social interaction in and between communities (e.g. Star, 2010; Bryant et al. 2005, Palen et -l. 2010, Keegan et al. 2016), specifically Robinson’s (1993) notion of com­mon artifact and Star (1989, 2010)’s analyses of boundary objects in overlapping prac­tices and commu­nities. Boundary objects address the tensions between plastic, open and local use, versus standardiza­tion and robustness across sites. Bødker (2015) points to possi­ble new mediating qualities of col­labo­rators holding e.g. big interactive objects in common with theoretical inspiration in how (Engeström, 1987; Engeström et al., 1997; Raeithel, 1996; Bardram, 1998) make analytical distinctions between three levels of collaboration that relate to how partici­pants share motive, object, and orientation toward one an­other. Bardram (1998) elaborates on these levels to distinguish between different ways 2hat objects structure their sharing pro­cess. Unfortunately, this strand of theoretical work has largely been ignored in recent re­search, and revitalization may help my current project.
</p><p>
</p><p>Common interactive ob­jects, accordingly, do not stand alone. They exist in ecologies with other objects, used by people, not in sin­gular and isolated activities, but together in webs of activities and as boundary objects across activities.
</p><p>
</p><p>Common interactive objects have a history, and change over time. Change happens through use, and with interac­tive objects also through tailoring and re-programming (Bødker &amp; Christiansen 2012, Tetteroo et al. 2015, Tchounikine 2016). Versioning of programs as well as of office docu­ments are familiar examples of this. Time and reuse pre­sent challenges of control: In shared program repositories (Bødker 2000b), the sharing of objects is dependent on human intervention and media­tion. This is parallel to Engeström’s (2007) analysis of ‘runaway objects’ that have taken a life of their own and are under nobody’s control.
</p><p>
</p><p>Bardram &amp; Houben (2018) give a summary of state of the art when it comes to sharing and common objects by introducing the concept of collaborative affordances as “a relation between a [physical and/or digital] artifact and a set of human actors, that affords the opportunity for these actors to perform a collaborative action within a specific social context.” They address portability (the ability to physically carry, share, position, use in different places), collocated access, shared overview and mutual awareness (with reference to among others Heath &amp; Luff), and use these collaborative affordances to compare different kinds of prototypical common interactive objects, namely paper-based and electronic patient records.
